                Hello! I'm Sean Benoit, a rising 2nd year computer science student at the University of Washington.
                I'm interested in software engineering and have interests in machine learning, mathematics, and other 
                neat, applicable intersections of mathematics and software. In my free time, I love playing tennis, fitness,
                and enjoying the planet's natural beauty. 
            </p>
